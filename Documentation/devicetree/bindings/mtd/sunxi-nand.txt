Allwinner NAND Flash Controller (NFC)

Required properties:
- compatible : "allwinner,sun4i-nfc".
- reg : shall contain registers location and length for data and reg.
- interrupts : shall define the NFC interrupt.
- #address-cells: shall be set to 1. Encode the nand CS.
- #size-cells : shall be set to 0.
- clocks : shall reference NFC clocks.
- clock-names : NFC internal clock names. Shall contain :
    * "ahb_clk" : AHB gating clock
    * "sclk" : NFC clock

Optional children nodes:
Children nodes represent the available nand chips.

Required properties:
- reg : shall contain the CS ids (a given chip might use several CS)
